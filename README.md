# Arduino-to-Thinger.io
Connecting the Arduino Uno Wifi Rev2 to the Thinger.io interface

To do that: 
1) Create an account in Thinger.io
2) Go to devices, and add a new device.
3) There enter all fields necessary. 
4) Those info will be the ones to put on the arduino code in replace of the username, device_id, and device_credentials.
5) The SSID and SSID_password are your home's wifi credentials.
